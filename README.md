    <p>I would like to see Affinity Publisher have built-in world-ready paragraph composer.

This function would generate a very nice text handling (both on screen and on printout). No unnecessary spacing between words.

Currently InDesign give us nicer text output - but a future Affinity Publisher with world-ready paragraph composer should give equal nice text output as InDesign.</p>
